[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20now-Visit%20Releases-brightgreen)](https://github.com/OmerVs/austin-housing-price-prediction/releases)

## 📖 Overview

The Austin Housing Price Prediction project uses machine learning to predict housing prices in Austin, Texas. This model employs the CatBoost algorithm for accurate predictions. It performs well, achieving a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of $160. The project leverages 132 features derived from 35 original attributes. It incorporates techniques like geospatial analysis and text mining to enhance the prediction accuracy.

The project also evaluates seven different machine learning algorithms using five-fold cross-validation to ensure reliability.
